# General Ledger (App 210) — Deployment Notes

Canonical platform-wide SQLcl/ORDS rules live in `final apps/Admin/docs/deployment-notes.md §2`.
This file holds GL-specific deploy steps, history, and gotchas. **Update on every deploy.**

## Deploy checklist
1. **DB scripts** via SQLcl `sql -name prod_mcp` (CRLF, UTF-8 no BOM, `SET DEFINE OFF`, `SET SQLBLANKLINES ON`):
   - `01_gl_synonyms.sql` — **own fresh session** (ORA-01471 rule).
   - `02_gl_ddl.sql` → `03_gl_pkg.sql` → `04_gl_views.sql`.
   - `06_gl_seed.sql` — run with `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` (Arabic class-type names);
     regenerate from CSVs first with `python db/gen_seed.py` if `db/source/*.csv` changed.
   - `05_gl_ords.sql` — **own fresh session**. It DELETE_MODULEs gl.rest — **always re-run the
     ADDITIVE scripts `07` (butil), `08` (rebuild endpoint), `09` (mappings drill) and `10`
     (actuals/lines doc numbers) right after any 05 re-run.** (09 and 10 are also source-synced
     into 05, so a full 05 re-run carries their changes — re-running them is still harmless.)
   - After a **structural** ATD reload (new/renamed columns): UI **Rebuild views** button
     (= `POST /gl/actuals/rebuild` → `prod.dct_views_rebuild`, db/v2/38) re-creates the base
     pass-throughs + recompiles + refreshes. If it reports views still invalid → edit/re-run the
     owning script (`db/v2/32`/`34`/`36`/`37`, `04_gl_views.sql`).
2. **Frontend** — bump `window.APP_VERSION` in `Jet/index.html`. A change under `final apps/shared/`
   requires bumping `APP_VERSION` in ALL apps (cache-bust).
3. **Smoke** — `python Jet/dev-proxy.py` (DEV_PROXY_PORT=8090), quick-login via Admin, load
   `/GL/Jet/index.html`; check Overview counts, Classifications CRUD, a Mapping with start/end
   (overlap → toast), Explorer as-of + CSV.

## History
- **2026-07-08 — Butil GRN drawer: + PO #, PO Line, Supplier (DB-only) + web-tier release.**
  The Budget Utilization "Actual GRN — receipts" drawer now also traces each receipt to its PO:
  `07_gl_budget_util_ords.sql` grn metric gained `po`/`poLine`/`supplier` columns (de-duped
  `po_headers`/`po_lines` joins via `grn_all_v2.po_header_id`/`po_line_id`, same pattern as the
  PO drawer). Redeployed 07 (fresh session); no frontend change. Also pushed web-tier release
  `20260708225930` via `webtier/deploy_frontend.sh` (no APP_VERSION bump — no frontend files
  changed; ORDS changes are live through the nginx `/ords/` proxy regardless).
  Verified through BOTH the ADB URL and `https://129.151.159.189/`: project 4511000854 GRN drill
  → 3 receipts, all PO 451102006105 line 1 supplier BEST MOMENTS EVENTS L.L.C, total 20,549,700
  reconciles; aggregate mode 1000 rows with 0 missing PO #.
- **2026-07-07 — Drill-down drawers: document number + line, no zero-amount lines (DB-only).**
  User request: every drill-down drawer identifies rows by **document number + line number**
  (AP invoice #/line, GRN #/line, PR #/line, PO #/line) instead of transaction-id-looking values,
  and hides zero-amount lines. No frontend change (drawer columns are server-driven) —
  APP_VERSION stays 1.10.0.
  - `07_gl_budget_util_ords.sql` (re-run whole, fresh session) — `GET /gl/butil/lines`, all four
    metrics, both row + aggregate modes: **ap** + `Line` (`ap_invoice_distributions.line_number`);
    **grn** relabelled `GRN #` + `Line` (`grn_all_v2.receipt_line_number`); **pr** + `Line`
    (`pr_lines.pr_line` via de-duped `pr_line_id` join); **po** already had PO #/Line. Zero-amount
    filters: ap/grn/pr `amount <> 0`, po `open > 0` (fully-received lines vanish). Zeros add
    nothing to SUM, so **drill totals still reconcile** to the row/card figures.
  - NEW `10_gl_actuals_lines_docnum.sql` — **ADDITIVE, DEFINE_HANDLER-only** upgrade of
    `GET /gl/actuals/lines` (source synced into 05): **apdirect** drawer showed the raw
    **`invoice_id` transaction id** — now the real AP invoice number (de-duped `ap_invoices`
    join, `#id` fallback) + invoice line + zero-amount filter; **grn** drawer relabelled `GRN #`
    + receipt line. Other actuals metrics untouched (PO drawers already show PO #/Line; the PR
    drawer aggregates at PR-header grain by design).
  - Verified: SQLcl reconciliation harness — all 4 butil drills PASS (drill total == row figure,
    0 zero rows, 0 null lines); live HTTP smoke as NASER.ALKHAJA **31/31 PASS** (agg + row modes
    reconcile; apdirect 0 id-fallbacks; actuals grn sample receipt 4513075482 line 1).
- **2026-07-06 — PR/PO charge-account format fix (`prod.dct_cc_canon`, db/v2/40).** The 2026-07-05
  ATD reload flipped `CHARGE_ACCOUNT` on `ATD_PR_DISTRIBUTIONS`/`ATD_PO_DISTRIBUTIONS` to the same
  **re-ordered dot format** that hit `ATD_GL_BALANCES` on 07-02 — every charge_account↔COA join
  matched ZERO rows (PR 0/4,559, PO 0/2,783), so the Actuals report showed **Commitment (PR) and
  Obligation (PO) all zeros** (user-reported). Fix = **`prod.dct_cc_canon(cc)`** function with
  format auto-detection (dash = legacy → dots; dot w/ 7-digit token#2 = already canonical;
  6-digit token#2 = program-first re-ordered feed → re-order) — self-heals if a future reload
  flips back. **RULE: every `charge_account` ↔ COA join/key goes through `prod.dct_cc_canon`**
  (GL_BALANCES keeps the pure-SQL `GL_BALANCES_CC` view).
  - Re-pointed: `db/v2/36` (PR view cc), `db/v2/32` (`DCT_ACTUAL_V` ap_po_match/PO/GRN branches +
    `DCT_BUDGET_ACTUAL_V` spine/po_agg/grn_agg), `db/v2/34` (grn_ytd + po_base), `db/v2/37`
    (po_dist + f_pr attribute cc), `05_gl_ords.sql` (8 drill filters + 3 dashboard snap joins) —
    then 05 republished + 07 + 08 re-run per the rule.
  - Verified: canon unit test (all 3 forms); PR 4,547/4,559 + PO 2,782/2,783 matched; 07-2026
    report rows carry Commitment 1,940.3M / Open 448.3M / PO 1,514.8M / Open 475.3M with sectors;
    drill + dashboard queries return rows; butil 2026 totals intact AND **sector coverage now
    100%** (canon fixed the transaction-based sector fallback); 19 templates; 0 invalid objects.
    No frontend change (APP_VERSION stays 1.10.0).
- **2026-07-05 — Classifications assignments drawer (v1.10.0).** Clicking a row on the
  Classifications values table opens an **extra-wide (1120px) right-edge drawer** with that value's
  full assignment list — segment code + dimension description, editable start/end dates + notes,
  CURRENT/PAST/NEW chips — with top-right **+ Add / Close / Save** buttons. Add = new row with a
  datalist segment picker (`/segments/:key/values`, description auto-fills); Save = sequential
  POST (new) / PUT (dirty) with overlap errors surfaced in a drawer error bar; per-row ✕ deletes.
  - ORDS: `09_gl_class_drill_ords.sql` — **ADDITIVE, DEFINE_HANDLER-only** upgrade of
    `GET /gl/mappings`: `?valueid=` filter + `segmentDesc` per row (GL_SRC_* dimension matched on
    the normalized segment value; live coverage 214/216). Source is **synced into 05**, so a full
    05 re-run already carries it — 09 exists to deploy without republishing the module. NB the
    platform gotcha: `ORDS.DEFINE_TEMPLATE` on an existing template silently DROPS its other
    handlers — 09 deliberately never calls it (POST /mappings verified surviving).
  - Frontend v1.10.0: row click + `clickBubble:false` on the row Edit/Delete buttons; `.dw-xw`
    wide-drawer modifier + `.dw-h .btn.solid` (inverted Save) + `.dw-err` + `.clsdw-tbl` styles.
  - Verified: handler live-run (CULTURE → its 13 assignments with descriptions), POST handler
    intact, `node --check` clean, Playwright mock-render PASS (open → +Add → desc autofill →
    Save → Close; 0 console errors).
- **2026-07-02 — Rebuild-views button (v1.9.0) + GL balances feed format fix (GL_BALANCES_CC).**
  Two things: a UI recovery button for structural ATD reloads, and an incident fix it immediately
  surfaced — the reloaded `ATD_GL_BALANCES` lost its dimension columns (`COST_CENTER`/`ACCOUNT_CODE`/
  `GL_COMBINATION`/`FUNDS_AVAILABLE`…) AND its `CONCATENATED_SEGMENTS` came back dot-separated in a
  **different segment order** (`entity.program.cost_center.budget_group.account.entity_specific.`
  `appropriation.intercompany.future1.future2`) — every gl_balances↔COA join silently matched ZERO
  rows (Actuals Budget/GL-Actual/Funds-GL figures empty).
  - DB: `db/v2/38` **`prod.dct_views_rebuild`** (re-creates the 16 `SELECT *` pass-throughs over
    `ATD_*`, calls `dct_actuals_refresh` [snapshot + 2-pass recompile], returns rebuilt count + any
    views still INVALID; +`GRANT CREATE VIEW TO PROD` — definer-rights needs the direct grant).
    `db/v2/32` adds **`GL_BALANCES_CC`** — the ONE canonical remap of the re-ordered
    `CONCATENATED_SEGMENTS` (legacy dash format still accepted); `DCT_ACTUAL_V` GL branch +
    `DCT_BUDGET_ACTUAL_V` re-pointed. `db/v2/34` `gl_ytd` re-pointed. `04_gl_views.sql`
    `DCT_GL_BALANCES_V` rewritten (dimensions via `DCT_GL_COA_V` on `GL_BALANCES_CC.cc_string` —
    **re-run 32 before 04**). Dropped orphaned live-only draft `DCT_PROJECT_BUDGET_V` (referenced
    long-gone `PROJECT_BALANCES`).
  - ORDS: `08_gl_views_rebuild_ords.sql` — **ADDITIVE** `POST /gl/actuals/rebuild` (+ ADMIN synonym
    `dct_views_rebuild`, fresh session). `05_gl_ords.sql` had 9 direct
    `REPLACE(concatenated_segments,'-','.')` joins (drill budget/encumbrance/glactual + dashboard
    bySector/byProgram/byAppropriation) — all re-pointed to `gl_balances_cc.cc_string` and the whole
    module re-published (then 07 + 08 re-run per the rule). **After any 05 re-run, re-run 07 AND 08.**
  - Frontend v1.9.0: **Rebuild views** button (Overview + Budget Utilization page heads) with tooltip
    hint + confirm — "use only after a reload that changed table structure; plain reload → Refresh
    actuals"; toast lists views still invalid (= script edit needed).
  - Verified: rebuild proc live-run (16 rebuilt, invalid none); GL figures restored — 07-2026 Budget
    17,181.2M / GL Actual 1,728.1M / Funds GL 9,955.4M; balances match 9,508/10,351 vs COA (843
    combos absent from the `ATD_GL_CODE_COMBINATIONS` extract — source-side gap); `/balances` view
    9,508 with cost-centre / 9,464 with sector; endpoint registered; `node --check` clean.
- **2026-07-02 — Budget Utilization KPI-card (aggregate) drill-down (v1.8.0).** Follow-up to v1.7.0:
  the user expected the prominent **KPI cards** (Actual AP / GRN / Commitment PR / Obligation PO) to be
  clickable, not just the table cells. Now both are: cards drill the **whole filtered set** (aggregate),
  table cells drill the single row. DEPLOYED as ADMIN (`sql` ADMIN@prod_high, fresh session) — VALID.
  - ORDS `07_gl_butil_ords`: `/gl/butil/lines` now takes `year+metric` with EITHER `project[+task+etype]`
    (row) OR `projecttype/sector/search` (card aggregate). ONE `kys` key-set CTE (`SELECT … FROM dual
    WHERE :project IS NOT NULL UNION ALL SELECT … FROM dct_budget_utilization_v WHERE :project IS NULL
    AND <filters>`) drives both; fact totals via `COUNT/SUM OVER ()` windows (rows capped 1000, total/count
    full). Response adds `aggregate` + `count`. **Fan-out fix:** the PO branch's `po_headers`+`po_lines`
    joins and the PR branch's `pr_headers` join are now de-duped via grouped subqueries — a raw join
    inflated aggregate PO (30.9M vs true 25.19M) when a PO line had duplicate header/line rows.
  - Frontend v1.8.0: `openBuAgg(metric)` + `.kstat-click` cards (hover ⤢ + dotted underline) + `drillCount`/
    `drillCapNote` ("showing top N of M"); aggregate drawer adds Project/Task columns + filter context.
  - Verified against LIVE data (ADMIN): row totals ap 43,966/grn 1,059,704/pr 200,734/po 972,771 and
    aggregate (sector=Culture) ap 50,030,599/grn 130,050,118/pr 107,576,885/po 25,188,034 ALL reconcile
    to the card/row figures; handler compiled clean; both endpoint modes route (401 unauth); drawer
    Playwright-verified (card→aggregate w/ cap note, cell→row).
- **2026-07-02 — Budget Utilization figure drill-down (v1.7.0).** The four money figures on each
  Budget Utilization row (Actual AP / Actual GRN / Commitment PR / Obligation PO) are now clickable
  and drill to their supporting transaction lines in a **right-edge slide-in drawer** (mirrors the
  platform edit-drawer template; brand-themed, RTL-aware). Each drill total reconciles exactly to
  the row figure.
  - ORDS: `07_gl_budget_util_ords.sql` — **ADDITIVE**, new `GET /gl/butil/lines?year=&project=&task=&etype=&metric=`
    (metric `ap|grn|pr|po`). Filters/amounts replicate the `DCT_BUDGET_UTILIZATION_V` fact CTEs
    (db/v2/37) keyed by the same grain (year × project_number × task_number × expenditure_type, all
    charge accounts). **`ap`** = no-PO validated invoice distributions (invoice #, date, vendor,
    currency, invoice amount, distribution AED, validation, **derived payment status** from
    `invoice_amount_paid`, description); **`grn`** = receipts; **`pr`** = Reserved PR distributions;
    **`po`** = Reserved/Partially-Liquidated PO distributions, **GRN-netted open** amount.
    **Run as ADMIN in a fresh SQLcl session** (`sql -name prod_mcp @07_gl_budget_util_ords.sql`) —
    ORDS modules are ADMIN-owned; re-run 07 again if `05_gl_ords.sql` is ever re-run.
  - Frontend v1.7.0: `openBuDrill(row, metric)` → `.dw-*` drawer (new CSS in `app.css`, markup in
    `index.html`), reuses the existing drill observables; four `.money-cell` cells + header hint
    tooltips. `node --check` clean; drawer visually verified via Playwright (mocked API): brand
    header, eyebrow=project·name, context=task·expenditure type, 9-col AP table, total reconciles.
  - Verified against live data (PROD, as user `prod`): all four drill totals reconcile to a real
    2026 row (AP 43,966 / GRN 1,059,704 / PR 200,734 / PO 972,771); handler body compiled + ran as
    a throwaway PROD procedure (APEX_JSON scaffolding clean) — final ORDS registration still needs
    the ADMIN deploy above.
- **2026-07-02 — Budget Utilization page (v1.6.0) + self-healing refresh + PROJECT_NUMBER type fix.**
  New project-costing report: ONE row per Budget Year × Project × Task × Expenditure Type
  (budget > 0 only), **Budget Year is a mandatory filter**. Budget from the new
  `ATD_PROJECTS_BUDGET` extract; AP/GRN/open PR/open PO year-scoped by their dates;
  Fund Available = Budget − AP − GRN − Open PR − Open PO. Sector via the DEFINED SECTOR map from
  the task's `COST_CENTER`; Appropriation/Program from `ATD_TASKS`; Chapter via the CHAPTER map.
  - DB: `db/v2/37` `DCT_BUDGET_UTILIZATION_V` (re-run `db/v2/32` FIRST so `projects_budget`/`tasks`
    pass-throughs expose `BUDGET_YEAR` + task `COST_CENTER`); `db/v2/33` `dct_actuals_refresh` now
    also **recompiles INVALID PROD views** (2 passes) — hourly job + both Refresh buttons self-heal
    after ATD reloads (NB: recompile only; a `SELECT *` base view still needs a 32/36 re-run to
    EXPOSE new columns). Also in `db/v2/32`: `DCT_ACTUAL_V` ORA-01790 fix after
    `ATD_PROJECTS.PROJECT_NUMBER` became VARCHAR2 ('T4514' Trust numbers).
  - ORDS: `07_gl_budget_util_ords.sql` — **ADDITIVE** to gl.rest (`GET /gl/butil/filters`,
    `GET /gl/butil?year=` [400 without year]). **If `05_gl_ords.sql` is ever re-run (it
    DELETE_MODULEs gl.rest), re-run 07 right after it.**
  - Frontend v1.6.0: new **Budget Utilization** nav page — mandatory Budget Year select (default =
    latest), Project Type/Sector/Search filters, 6 totals cards, 17-column table, CSV, pagination.
  - Verified: view VALID (2026: 1,352 rows / 5,277.4M, full-year aggregate 1.4 s), templates
    registered, handler queries live-run, `node --check` clean.
  - Known data gaps (source-side, tracked in `docs/budget_utilization_missing_data.md`): 73 lines
    without Sector (tasks missing `COST_CENTER`), 13 lines without Chapter (unmapped appropriations
    50723/50729/50730/0).
- **2026-07-02 — Actuals: 3-figure Commitment/Obligation + Open Encumbrance + Funds calc (v1.5.0, Batch B).**
  Real requisitions now drive Commitment; PO obligation split into three funds-status buckets with a
  GRN-netted Open Obligation. Grouped-cell display.
  - DB: `db/v2/36` `DCT_PR_COMMITMENT_PERIOD_V` → 3 figures (`pr_total_ytd`=Reserved+Liquidated,
    `pr_open_commitment_ytd`=Reserved, `pr_pipeline_ytd`=Not-reserved, `pr_count`). `db/v2/34`
    rewritten: PO de-duped by `po_distribution_id` → `total_po_ytd` (all except Failed/Passed),
    `open_obligation_ytd` = (Reserved+Partially Liquidated) **netted by GRN** `GREATEST(amt−Σgrn,0)`
    (grn via `grn_all_v2.po_distribution_id`), `po_pipeline_ytd` (Failed/Passed); LEFT JOIN the PR
    view; `open_encumbrance_ytd` = open commitment + open obligation; `funds_available_calc_ytd` =
    Budget − Open PO − Open PR − GRN − AP Direct (GL `funds_available_ytd` kept as the 2nd figure).
  - ORDS (`05_gl_ords.sql`, whole module, fresh session — **no new synonyms**, all `prod.`-qualified):
    `/actuals` emits prTotal/openCommitment/commitmentPipeline/totalPo/openObligation/poPipeline/
    openEncumbrance/fundsAvailable/fundsAvailableCalc; `/actuals/lines` — commitment/openCommitment/
    **commitmentPipeline** → real PR lines (`pr_distributions`+`pr_headers`, AED via `DCT_CURRENCY_CODES`),
    obligation/**poPipeline** → PO lines, openObligation → GRN-netted (Ordered/Received/Open columns).
  - Frontend v1.5.0: **grouped cells** — Commitment & Obligation each show Total/Open/Pipeline stacked
    (count on the Total row), Funds Available cell shows GL/Calc; +Open Encumbrance column; 14 KPI cards.
  - Verified: view VALID + figures reconcile (PR 1.89B/412.7M/4.71B, PO 1.52B/474.0M/2.1M, OpenEnc
    886.7M); drill queries ran live; `node --check`; Playwright mock-render (0 console errors).
    Deploy order: `db/v2/36` → `db/v2/34` → `05_gl_ords.sql` (fresh session).
  - **Currency caveat:** non-AED PR distributions are converted via the `DCT_CURRENCY_CODES` snapshot
    (manual ISO master, single RATE_DATE 19-May-2026) — the only rate source (PR tables carry none).
    Pending user check of whether PR line details include a rate.
- **2026-07-01 — PR reporting views created (Batch B step 1 — DB only, not yet integrated).**
  New `db/v2/36_dct_pr_views.sql`: base pass-throughs `prod.pr_headers`/`pr_lines`/`pr_distributions`
  (over the `ATD_PR_*` tables) + **`DCT_PR_COMMITMENT_PERIOD_V`** (per GL combination × period,
  YTD via `BUDGET_DATE<period-end`, AED via the `DCT_CURRENCY_CODES` snapshot rate — the PR tables
  carry NO transaction rate). Measures (06-2026): `pr_commitment_ytd` = `FUNDS_STATUS='Reserved'`
  (currently-reserved requisitions) = 412.7M; `pr_open_commitment_ytd` = Reserved & PR line has no
  PO (disjoint from Open PO) = 369.4M; `pr_count`/`open_pr_count` = distinct PR headers. Excludes
  `'Not reserved'` drafts (4.75B) AND `'Liquidated'` (already POs → shown under Obligation). All VALID.
  **NOT yet wired into `DCT_BUDGET_ACTUAL_PERIOD_V` / ORDS / frontend** — next step: #3 repoint the
  commitment source, #4 Encumbrance = Open PR + Open PO, #6b calculated Funds Available.
- **2026-07-01 — Actuals: AP Direct redefine + SLA Actual + PO/PR counts (v1.4.0).** (User comments
  batch A of 6; #3/#4/#6b pending the user's PR_HEADER/PR_LINES/PR_DISTRIBUTIONS tables.)
  - **#1 AP Direct** now = AP distribution lines with **`po_number IS NULL`** (true direct AP, no PO
    reference), replacing the old "unmatched-to-`po_distributions`" logic (dropped the `ap_po_match`
    CTE in `db/v2/34` `ap_ytd` + the inline match subquery in the `apdirect` drill). Live impact:
    06-2026 YTD AP Direct 1.322B → **1.292B** (the delta = AP lines that carry a po_number but don't
    match a PO distribution — now excluded).
  - **#2 SLA Actual** ("Subledger Actuals") = GRN Actual + AP Direct (≈ 2.27B). Emitted by `/actuals`
    (`slaActual` in totals + items); new KPI card + non-drillable table column + ⓘ hint.
  - **#5 PO/PR counts:** `DCT_BUDGET_ACTUAL_PERIOD_V` gained `po_count` (distinct po_header_id) +
    `pr_count` (distinct pr_number) per combination; `/actuals` items emit `poCount`/`prCount`; the
    Obligation/Commitment cells show the amount with a count sub-line ("N POs" / "N PRs"). PR count is
    interim from `po_distributions` until the dedicated PR_* tables arrive (#3).
  - Deploy order: `db/v2/34` → `05_gl_ords.sql` (fresh session, no new synonyms). Verified: view VALID,
    AP Direct drill query ran live (no ORA errors), `node --check`, Playwright mock-render (0 errors).
- **2026-06-30 — Actuals report: Open Commitment / Open Obligation + visible hint (v1.3.0).**
  - DB: added `open_commitment_ytd` + `open_obligation_ytd` to `DCT_BUDGET_ACTUAL_PERIOD_V`
    (`db/v2/34`) — the **unliquidated** subset of obligation/commitment = PO distribution lines
    whose budget is still encumbered (`FUNDS_STATUS IN ('Reserved','Partially Liquidated')`),
    de-duped per natural key (the amount/`SCHEDULE_UNBILLED_AMOUNT` columns are unreliable in
    this Fusion load, so "open" is driven by FUNDS_STATUS, not ordered−billed). Verified VALID;
    06-2026 open = 723.08M (both), ⊆ commitment 1.504B ⊆ obligation 1.510B.
  - ORDS (`05_gl_ords.sql`, whole module, fresh session — no new synonyms): `/actuals` emits
    `openCommitment`/`openObligation` in `totals` + `items` and accepts them as `source` filter
    values; `/actuals/lines` gains `openCommitment` (→ open PR lines) and `openObligation`
    (→ open PO lines) drill metrics (same columns as commitment/obligation, FUNDS_STATUS-filtered).
  - Frontend (v1.3.0): 2 new KPI cards (Open Commitment / Open Obligation) + 2 new drillable
    table columns; the four PO-derived headers (Commitment/Obligation/Open Commitment/Open
    Obligation) now show a **visible ⓘ hint marker** (`.hint-i`) carrying the explanatory tooltip
    (kept the existing "Commitment (PR)" / "Obligation (PO)" wording); 2 new source-filter options;
    CSV includes the open columns.
  - Verified: view VALID + open figures match probe; all new handler queries executed live against
    PROD (no ORA errors); `node --check`; Playwright mock-render of Actuals + Open-Obligation drill
    + Dashboard (0 console/binding errors). Deploy order: `db/v2/34` → `05_gl_ords.sql` (fresh session).
- **2026-06-30 — Actuals report: Commitment/Obligation + extra filters + full width (v1.2.0).**
  - DB: added `commitment_ytd` (PR-backed PO distribution lines) + `obligation_ytd` (all PO
    distribution lines) to `DCT_BUDGET_ACTUAL_PERIOD_V` (`db/v2/34`), read live from
    `po_distributions` (de-duped per natural key; `gl_balances.OBLIGATIONS` is 0 in this Fusion
    config so POs come from `po_distributions`; commitment = the PR-backed subset of obligation).
  - ORDS (`05_gl_ords.sql`, re-run whole module, fresh session — no new synonyms):
    `/actuals/filters` now also returns `accounts` + `costCenters` LOVs; `/actuals` gains
    `account`/`costcenter`/`source` filters and emits `commitment`/`obligation` in totals + items;
    `/actuals/lines` gains `commitment` (→ PR lines) and `obligation` (→ PO lines) drill metrics.
  - Frontend (v1.2.0): Actuals + Dashboard pages now use the full viewport width (`.wrap.wide`);
    3 new search criteria (Account, Cost center, Transaction source); 2 new KPI cards + 2 new
    drillable table columns (Commitment / Obligation) with header hints; CSV includes them.
  - Verified: view VALID + commitment⊆obligation (1.504B ⊆ 1.510B, 06-2026); all new handler
    queries executed live against PROD (no ORA errors); `node --check` + KO comment balance.
    Deploy order: `db/v2/34` → `05_gl_ords.sql` (fresh session).
- **2026-06-30 — Actuals reporting + Executive dashboard (v1.1.0).** New **Actuals** (Budget vs
  Actual) and **Dashboard** pages over the actuals reporting layer (`db/v2/32–35`):
  - DB: added `appropriation_code`/`_desc` to `DCT_BUDGET_ACTUAL_PERIOD_V` (`db/v2/34`); new hourly
    job `DCT_ACTUALS_REFRESH_JOB` for `prod.dct_actuals_refresh` (`db/v2/35`).
  - ORDS (`05_gl_ords.sql`, re-run whole module, fresh session): `/actuals/filters`, `/actuals`,
    `/actuals/lines`, `/dashboard`, `POST /actuals/refresh` + 9 new ADMIN→PROD synonyms
    (period view, snapshot, refresh proc, base AP/PO/GRN/GL views).
  - Frontend: Actuals report (mandatory period + Sector/Chapter/DCT-Program/Appropriation filters,
    business-question answer cards, full-width table with header hints + combination tooltip + row
    hover, per-figure drill-down modal, Search/Reset, CSV); Executive dashboard (utilisation gauge,
    period-over-period trend, by sector/program/appropriation bars, auto-insights — all hand-built
    SVG/CSS, no chart lib); **Refresh actuals** button on Overview/Actuals/Dashboard.
  - Verified: live SQL probes + handler JSON harness against PROD; Playwright mock-render of both
    pages + drill (0 console/binding errors). Deploy order: `db/v2/33` (snapshot, if not present) →
    `db/v2/32` → `db/v2/34` → `db/v2/35` → `05_gl_ords.sql`.
- **2026-06-28 — Initial release (v1.0.0).** All layers deployed + verified end-to-end (Playwright).
  COA view 9,338 rows (no fan-out), 91% sector-classified. Registered in switcher + i18n.

## Gotchas (GL-specific)
- **`GL_SRC_*` synonyms** are the only thing that knows the base table is `ATD_GL_*`. On the
  planned rename to `GL_*`, re-run `01_gl_synonyms.sql` with the new targets — nothing else changes.
- **Description-list fan-out:** the Fusion list tables contain duplicate codes (e.g. program `0` =
  "Unspecified"/"Un specified", used by 5,605 combinations). `DCT_GL_COA_V` de-duplicates every
  description join with `GROUP BY` — never join the raw list tables 1:1 or the grain explodes.
- **Segment widths (zero-pad):** entity 3, cost-center 7, account 6, appropriation 6, **program 6**.
  Segments are stored `NUMBER` (lossy) so the view/map normalize via `DCT_GL_CLASS_PKG.norm`.
- **Program ↔ PBB:** codes differ (`10100` vs PBB `070100`); mappings are matched by *description*,
  not arithmetic. 33 of 35 used program codes matched.
- **Parallel DML:** the seed sets `ALTER SESSION DISABLE PARALLEL DML` (consecutive MERGEs on a
  parallel-enabled table → ORA-12839).
- **As-of:** `DCT_GL_CLASS_PKG.set_asof(date)` then SELECT the view; the `/combinations?asof=` and
  `/balances?asof=` handlers set/clear the `GL_CTX` context per request.
